## Description

Roulette is a popular game played in casinos around the world and originated in France sometime in the mid-17th century. It is quite a popular game because there is very little knowledge required to play effectively. There are multiple betting options which include single number bets, red or black, evens or odds, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dozens. Players place chips on a board with varying color and number combinations and the dealer spins a wheel with corresponding combinations where a ball eventually lands and denotes winning bets.
